# Analyzing Hospital Appointments

In this project, i am going to investigate the [Medical Appointment No Shows](https://www.kaggle.com/joniarroba/noshowappointments) dataset. This project is aimed at finding possible reasons for patients to miss their appointment at the hospital. This involves studing the relationship of different features (such as health issues, age, etc.) with patients' arrival at the appointed location. Generally, this project investigates the reasons for a patient to show up or not at an appointment.

The questions raised for analyzing the data are:

* Are some appointment days difficult for patients to show up?
* Are SMS notified patients more likely to show up on their appointment?
* Are patients with healthcare scholarship more likely to show up at their appointment?
